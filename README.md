# StatisticalCarValuation
This project involves assessment of best car value using multivariate and polynomial regression.     
The model was evaluated via regression, residual and distribution plot using seaborn package.       
The model accuracy was computed using k-fold cross-validation score (R2) and the fitting was improved through ridge regression by using grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
